# chatapp-backend
This is a chatapp -- Just to get upskilled and work with a lot of tech for fun. :)

This is a personal project -- working during my job hunt. I have been a python-sql-ML guy and I want to move towards full stack development with hands on with a lot of tech. Chatapp essentially requires a lot of different techs that I havn't explored and so I had to choose this project. I will be using js for backand and frontend as well, cassendra for my db needs. will update the tech stack along the way.
